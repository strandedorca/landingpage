# PROJECT'S TITLE 
Odin Project #2 - Landing Page
# PROJECT'S DESCRIPTION
This is the second project I did following The Odin Project. I decided to make it a bit different from what I was told to do so that I am more interested and engaged. It's probably taken more time than it should but I really enjoy the process and I've learned a lot.
