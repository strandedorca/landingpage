# Project's Description
This is the second project I did following The Odin Project. I decided to make it a bit different from what I was told to do so that I am more interested and engaged. It's probably taken more time than it should but I really enjoy the process and I've learned a lot.

# What I've learned
- How to desig layout for a webpage with flexbox and margin, padding.
- Use `<div>` to structure and divide a page.
- The process of creating a webpage from start to finish from a blankpage (Divide and Conquer).
- The importance of `box-sizing: box-model` (box-model changes the way dimensions are measured for every element so it includes borders and padding instead of just the content). Other two possible values are `content-box`, `padding-box`.
# Techniques I've learned
